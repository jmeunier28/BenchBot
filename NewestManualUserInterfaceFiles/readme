Two different serial communications protocols were developed. One sends a 3-tuple of angles (of type float) that describe a point B to move to,
to the arduino, which then moves there using the AccelStepper library. The other protocol (the one located here) uses a character based protocol 
to send a custom defined sequence of steps that describe a line. The step sequence is a list of chars structured as follows:
['l' (indicates start of a single line's data), <Dir>, <Dir>, <Dir>, 's'(indicates start of a single line's step sequence),
<step>, <step>, <step>,...., 'e']

'l' (indicates start of a single line's data)
<Dir> Three characters after the 'l' character describe the direction that the 3 stepper motors on the robot arm need to rotate in. 
      takes on the value of 'H' or 'L'. depending on the character, the direction of the stepper motor


packets of configurable lengths. The protocol is
