Two different serial communications protocols were developed. One sends a 3-tuple of angles (of type float) that describe a point B to move to,
to the arduino, which then moves there using the AccelStepper library. The other protocol (the one located here) uses a character based protocol 
to send a custom defined sequence of steps that describe a line. The step sequence is a list of chars structured as follows:
['l' (indicates start of a single line's data), <Dir>, <Dir>, <Dir>, 's'(indicates start of a single line's step sequence),
<step-base>, <step-upperArm>, <step-lowerArm>,...., 'e']

'l' indicates start of a single line's data

<Dir> Three characters after the 'l' character describe the direction that the 3 stepper motors on the robot arm need to rotate in. 
      In order from left to right (positions 1-3), the directions are specified for the base, upper arm, and lower arm stepper motors respectively.
      Each direction character takes on the value of 'H' or 'L' (upper case only). Depending on the character, the direction of the stepper motor
      is specified by sending a HIGH ('H') or LOW ('L') signal to the appropriate STEP min on the A4988 motor driver. 
      
's' inicates the start of a single line's step sequence

<step> A series of n steps (in 3-tuples) defines the step sequence needed for the arm to move in a straight line.
